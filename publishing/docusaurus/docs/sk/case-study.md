## Background

### 2.1 The USB Killer Threat

USB devices have become ubiquitous in modern technology, but with this widespread adoption comes significant security risks. The USB Killer represents one of the most destructive threats to computer hardware—a device that appears identical to a standard USB drive but is engineered to destroy connected systems through high-voltage electrical surges[^1].

**How USB Killers Operate:**

1. **Energy Harvesting:** The device extracts power from the USB port and stores it in internal capacitors
2. **Voltage Surge:** It rapidly discharges stored energy, creating a voltage surge that overwhelms the system
3. **Hardware Damage:** Key components including motherboards, USB controllers, and peripherals suffer permanent damage[^1]

Modern USB Killer devices have evolved significantly. The USB Killer V4, for instance, features an internal rechargeable battery enabling "offline attacks" that can damage devices even when powered off, bypassing all known USB-C and Lightning security protocols[^4].

### 2.2 Real-World Incidents

The threat posed by USB Killers is not merely theoretical. In a notable 2019 incident, Vishwanath Akuthota, a former MBA student at the College of St. Rose in New York, used a USB Killer device purchased online to destroy 59 computers, seven monitors, and several computer-enhanced podiums. The total damage amounted to $51,109 in equipment costs plus $7,362 in employee investigation and replacement time[^2].

Akuthota filmed himself during the attacks, stating "I'm going to kill this guy," "it's dead," and "it's gone. Boom" as he destroyed the equipment[^2]. This incident demonstrates how easily accessible these destructive devices have become and the significant financial impact they can cause to educational institutions and businesses.

Testing conducted by technology reviewers has shown that USB Killer devices can damage approximately 95% of tested devices, including modern smartphones (Galaxy Note 7, Google Pixel), tablets (iPad Pro), laptops (ThinkPad, MacBook Pro), gaming consoles (Xbox One), and even automotive infotainment systems[^3]. While some devices only suffer USB port damage, others experience complete system failure when the surge reaches critical components like the CPU.

## Problem Statement

Organizations face multiple challenges with USB connectivity:

1. **Physical Vulnerability:** Direct USB connections expose systems to electrical attacks and improper wiring damage
2. **Lack of Protection:** Most devices (95%) lack adequate surge protection on USB ports[^3]
3. **High Replacement Costs:** Damaged hardware often requires complete replacement rather than repair
4. **Operational Disruption:** System failures cause significant workflow interruptions
5. **Security Concerns:** Inability to authenticate devices before physical connection
6. **Limited Defense Options:** Port blockers and disabled ports reduce functionality

As noted in security research, "Cars, airplanes, routers, machines that control industrial centrifuges" all share this vulnerability, with the only real defense being "physically capping ports or educating people to never insert unknown hardware"[^3]. This limitation significantly impacts usability and operational efficiency.

## Solution Overview

Our BLE device adapter provides a wireless alternative to direct USB connections, fundamentally eliminating the physical pathway for electrical attacks. By utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy technology, the adapter enables data communication while maintaining complete electrical isolation between the host system and external devices.

**Core Innovation:** Replace vulnerable physical USB connections with secure wireless BLE communication, preventing any possibility of electrical surge damage to the host system.

## Technical Approach

### 5.1 BLE vs USB Communication

Our solution leverages Bluetooth Low Energy as defined in the Bluetooth 5.0 Core Specification. Unlike USB's direct electrical connection, BLE operates on the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to avoid interference[^5].

**Key Technical Specifications:**

- **Operating Frequency:** 2.400 GHz to 2.483.5 GHz with 40 channels spaced at 2 MHz intervals[^6]
- **Modulation Options:**
  - LE 1M PHY: 1 Mb/s (mandatory)
  - LE 2M PHY: 2 Mb/s (optional, implemented in our solution)
- **Communication Topology:** Point-to-Point with capability for Broadcasting and Mesh networks[^6]

### 5.2 Energy Efficiency Analysis

Energy efficiency was a critical design consideration. According to research by Luks and Tåqvist (2022), Bluetooth Low Energy achieves superior energy efficiency through several mechanisms:

1. **Reduced Active Time:** BLE can establish connections, transmit data, and terminate links in as little as 3ms compared to hundreds of milliseconds for Bluetooth Classic[^5]
2. **Efficient Scanning:** Uses only 3 advertising channels requiring 0.6-1.2ms scan periods versus 22.5ms for Bluetooth Classic's 32 channels[^5]
3. **Optimized Modulation:** GFSK modulation with index 0.45-0.55 provides lower power consumption[^5]
4. **Connection Intervals:** Predefined timing allows radio idle states between data exchanges[^6]

However, our comparative testing revealed important practical considerations. Using a Jody-W263 automotive-grade Bluetooth module, we measured:

- **BLE LE 2M PHY:** Average 6.35-6.82 mA effective current during data transmission
- **Bluetooth Classic (3 Mb/s):** Average 4.83-4.90 mA effective current during data transmission[^5]

While Bluetooth Classic showed better efficiency during active data transmission in our specific automotive-grade implementation, BLE's ability to rapidly sleep and wake provides overall better energy efficiency for intermittent device communication scenarios typical of our USB adapter use case.
