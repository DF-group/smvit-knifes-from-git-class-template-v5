## Post 1: The USB Killer Threat is Real

Did you know that 95% of devices can be destroyed by a simple USB device?

The USB Killer threat isn't science fiction—it's a $58,000 problem that destroyed 59 computers at one university in a single attack.

That's why we developed [brand name]—a BLE-powered adapter that completely eliminates the risk by removing physical USB connections altogether.

Because the best defense isn't blocking the surge... it's never letting it reach your system.

## Post 3: From Workshop to World-Changing Solution

Three students. One workshop. A mission to solve a $58,000 problem.

That's how [brand name] was born.

We saw the devastation USB Killer devices caused to universities, businesses, and critical infrastructure. We knew there had to be a better way than just "hoping people don't plug in unknown devices."

So we built it. 
Hand-soldered. Tested. Iterated. 
And created a solution that provides 100% electrical isolation through wireless BLE technology.

Sometimes the best innovations come from small teams with big determination.

## Post 4: The Real Cost of USB Attacks

$51,109 in equipment damage.
$7,362 in labor costs.
59 destroyed computers.
7 ruined monitors.
Countless hours of lost productivity.

This was the result of ONE person with a USB Killer device at a single university.

[brand name] eliminates this threat entirely by removing the physical connection pathway. 

Because you can't surge what you can't reach.

## Post 6: Engineering for the Impossible

"The only real defense is physically capping ports or educating people to never insert unknown hardware."

That's what the security experts said about USB Killer attacks.

We said: "What if there was a third option?"

[brand name] uses BLE technology to maintain USB functionality while achieving complete electrical isolation. 

No caps needed. 
No user training required. 
Just protection.

Sometimes innovation means questioning what everyone accepts as impossible.

## Post 8: Power Efficiency Meets Protection

We didn't just build [brand name] to be secure. We built it to be smart.

Using BLE 5.0 technology, our adapter achieves:
• Rapid connection/disconnection (<100ms)
• Optimized sleep states during idle
• <1 mA current in sleep mode
• Extended battery operation capability

Because protection shouldn't drain your power—or your resources.
